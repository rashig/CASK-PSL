# HBase Batch Source


Description
-----------
Batch source that reads from a column family in an HBase table.
This source differs from the Table source in that it does not use a CDAP dataset,
but reads directly from HBase.


Use Case
--------
This source is used when you want to read from a column family in an HBase table.
For example, you may want to read from an HBase table, filter some records out,
then write the results to a Database table. 


Properties
----------
**referenceName:** This will be used to uniquely identify this source for lineage, annotating metadata, etc.

**tableName:** The name of the table to read from. (Macro-enabled)

**columnFamily:** The name of the column family to read from. (Macro-enabled)

**schema:** Schema of records read from the table. Row columns map to record
fields. For example, if the schema contains a field named 'user' of type string, the value
of that field will be taken from the value stored in the 'user' column. Only simple types
are allowed (boolean, int, long, float, double, bytes, string).

**rowField:** Optional field name indicating that the field value should
come from the row key instead of a row column. The field name specified must be present in
the schema, and must not be nullable.

**zkQuorum:** The ZooKeeper quorum for the hbase instance you are reading from. This should
be a comma separated list of hosts that make up the quorum. You can find the correct value
by looking at the hbase.zookeeper.quorum setting in your hbase-site.xml file. This value
defaults to 'localhost'. (Macro-enabled)

**zkClientPort:** The client port used to connect to the ZooKeeper quorum.
You can find the correct value by looking at the hbase.zookeeper.quorum setting in your hbase-site.xml.
This value defaults to 2181. (Macro-enabled)


Example
-------
This example reads from the 'attr' column family of an HBase table named 'users':

    {
        "name": "HBase",
        "type": "batchsource",
        "properties": {
            "tableName": "users",
            "columnFamily": "attr",
            "rowField": "id",
            "zkQuorum": "host1,host2,host3",
            "zkClientPort": "2181",
            "schema": "{
                \"type\":\"record\",
                \"name\":\"user\",
                \"fields\":[
                    {\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":\"long\"},
                    {\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":\"string\"},
                    {\"name\":\"birthyear\",\"type\":\"int\"}
                ]
            }",
            "schema.row.field": "id"
        }
    }

It outputs records with this schema:

    +======================================+
    | field name     | type                |
    +======================================+
    | id             | long                |
    | name           | string              |
    | birthyear      | int                 |
    +======================================+

The 'id' field will be read from the row key of the table. The 'name' field will be read from the
'name' column in the table. The 'birthyear' field will be read from the 'birthyear' column in the
table. Any other columns in the Table will be ignored by the source.
