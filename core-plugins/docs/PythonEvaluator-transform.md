# Python Evaluator Transform


Description
-----------
Executes user-provided python code that transforms one record into zero or more records.
Each input record is converted into a dictionary which can be directly accessed in
python. The transform expects to receive a dictionary as input, which it can
process and emit zero or more transformed dictionaries, or emit an error dictionary using the provided emitter object.

Configuration
-------------
**script:** Python code defining how to transform one record into another. The script must
implement a function called ``'transform'``, which takes as input a Python dictionary (representing
the input record), an emitter object, and a context object (which contains CDAP metrics and logger).
The script can then use the emitter object to emit transformed Python dictionaries.

For example:

``'def transform(record, emitter, context): record['count'] *= 1024; emitter.emit(record)'``

will scale the ``'count'`` field of ``record`` by 1024.

**schema:** The schema of output objects. If no schema is given, it is assumed that the output
schema is the same as the input schema.


Example
-------
The transform checks each record's ``'subtotal'`` field: if the ``'subtotal'`` is negative, it emits an error;
else, it calculates the ``'tax'`` and ``'total'`` fields based on the ``'subtotal'``, and then returns a record
as a Python dictionary containing those three fields, with the error records written to the configured error dataset:

        }
    }


Known Issues
------------
The PythonEvaluator transform has a memory leak which affects the CDAP SDK.
Running it multiple times from within the same JVM in the CDAP SDK will result in an
OutOfMemoryError: PermGen Space (https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4222).
