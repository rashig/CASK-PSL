Example
-------
This example will read from an instance of Apache ActiveMQ running on port 61616 on 'localhost'.
It will poll the 'purchases' topic, reading up to 50 messages with each poll. A record is
emitted for each message read from the topic. The record consists of a single field named 'message'
containing the contents of the message:

    {
        "name": "JMS",
        "type": "realtimesource",
        "properties": {
            "jms.messages.receive": "50",
            "jms.destination.name": "purchases",
            "jms.factory.initial": "org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory",
            "jms.provider.url": "tcp://localhost:61616",
            "jms.plugin.custom.properties": "{\"topic.purchases\":\"purchases\"}"
        }
    }
