This project is a collection of Elasticsearch source and sink plugins. These plugins are currently available:

- Cassandra Batch Source
- Cassandra Batch Sink

Getting Started
===============

Following are instructions to build and deploy the Hydrator Cassandra plugins.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use the plugins, you must have CDAP version 3.2.0 or later. You can download CDAP Standalone that includes Hydrator `here <http://cask.co/downloads>`__

Apache Cassandra v. 2.1.0 is the only version of Apache Cassandra that the Hydrator plugins support.

Build Plugins
-------------

You get started with Hydrator plugins by building directly from the latest source code::

  git clone https://github.com/caskdata/hydrator-plugins.git
  cd hydrator-plugins
  mvn clean package -pl cassandra-plugins -am

After the build completes, you will have a JAR under the
``cassandra-plugins/target/`` directory.

Deploy Plugins
--------------

You can deploy the plugins using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact target/cassandra-plugins-<version>.jar \
         config-file target/cassandra-plugins-<version>.json
